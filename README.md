Imports necessary libraries.
Reads housing data from a CSV file.
Prepares the data.
Splits it into training and testing sets.
Builds Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
Evaluates model performance using accuracy scores and Mean Absolute Error.
Tunes hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.
Saves the trained model for future use.
Can predict housing prices for new input data.
